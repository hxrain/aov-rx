aov-rx README
=============

aov-rx is a malloc-free, wide-char based regular expression matching
library. This piece of code is designed to be part of MPDM [1] in the
future, but can also be used separately.

Please see the TODO file to know the completion status of this project.

Goals
-----

 - Not using dynamic memory,
 - using wide chars (wchar_t) natively,
 - returns the matching substring as offset + size,
 - source code being readable, and
 - being completely reentrant and thread-safe.

Features
--------

 - Start (^) and end of string ($) anchors
 - . (match any character)
 - Full quantifier support:
   - Curly bracket with optional minimum and maximum:
     - Exactly n matches ({n})
     - At least n matches ({n,})
     - At most m matches ({,m})
     - At least n and at most m matches ({n,m})
   - ? (match 0 or 1 occurrences, same as {0,1})
   - * (match 0 or many occurrences, same as {0,})
   - + (match 1 or many occurrences, same as {1,})
 - Alternate sets (str1|str2|str3)
 - Bracket-wrapped character sets, positive and negative ([0-9], [^0-9])

Features that will (probably) be, but not soon
----------------------------------------------

 - Optional multiline matching (i.e. ^ and $ matching lines inside
   the string instead of the start and the end of the string)

Features that (probably) will never be
--------------------------------------

 - Backreferences
