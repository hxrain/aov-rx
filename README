=============

 Angel Ortega <angel@triptico.com>

aov-rx is another regular expression matching library.

Goals
-----

 - Not using dynamic memory,
 - using wide chars (wchar_t) natively,
 - source code being readable, and
 - being completely reentrant and thread-safe.

Supported features
------------------

 - Start (^) and end of string ($) anchors
 - . (match any character)
 - ? (match 0 or 1 occurrences)
 - * (match 0 or many occurrences)
 - + (match 1 or many occurrences)
 - Alternate sets (str1|str2|str3)
 - Bracket-wrapped character sets, positive and negative ([0-9], [^0-9])
 - Special characters for sets a-la Perl (\d, \w)
