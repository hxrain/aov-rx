aov-rx README
=============

aov-rx is a malloc-free, wide-char based regular expression matching
library. This piece of code is designed to be part of MPDM [1] in the
future, but can also be used separately.

Please see the TODO file to know the completion status of this project.

Goals
-----

 - Not using dynamic memory,
 - using wide chars (wchar_t) natively,
 - source code being readable, and
 - being completely reentrant and thread-safe.

Features
--------

 - Start (^) and end of string ($) anchors
 - . (match any character)
 - ? (match 0 or 1 occurrences)
 - * (match 0 or many occurrences)
 - + (match 1 or many occurrences)
 - Alternate sets (str1|str2|str3)
 - Bracket-wrapped character sets, positive and negative ([0-9], [^0-9])
 - Special characters for sets a-la Perl (\d, \w)

Features that (probably) will never be
--------------------------------------

 - Backreferences
 - Greedy matching
